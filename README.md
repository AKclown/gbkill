## ü§° Delete git branches in batches [‰∏≠ÊñáÁâà](https://github.com/AKclown/gbkill/blob/main/README-ZH.md)

In daily development, we create a git branch function every time we make a requirement. Over time, many local and online branches will be accumulated. Then it is particularly important to have a tool to delete git branches in batches at this time. **`GBKILL` is a tool created to solve this need, allowing you to delete git branches more efficiently**

![logo.png](./docs/logo.png)

> This tool will list the `git branches` in the projects, and then you can `select in batches` the `git branches` that need to be deleted.

## ü§° Install

Actually you don't need to install it to use it! Just use the following command:

```ts
$ npx gbkill
```

Or you can install it:

```ts
$ npm i -g gbkill
```

## üèïÔ∏è Usage

> Enter `gbkill` in your `terminal`** (currently not compatible with Git in Windows terminal)**. `gbkill` will execute the `git command` to scan the `git branches` under your current project s and display them in the lists

| Key        | Description                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Space      | Press the `spacebar` to execute the `merged` branch deletion (**`recommendation: to prevent accidental deletion`**) |
| Tab        | Press the `Tab` to execute `merged \| unmerged` branch deletion (**`higher permissions than the Space`**)           |
| RightArrow | Press `-> ` to execute `Open \| Close`function of batch selection branch                                            |
| ‚Üì          | Press `‚Üì` to select branch                                                                                          |
| ‚Üë          | Press `‚Üë` to select branch                                                                                          |

**Hint**

> 1. The `merge` listed on the gbkill interface displays `yes` or `No` which is judged by `git branch --merged <name>`. You can specify the merged branch name by executing `gbkill --merged <name>`

> 2. When the `merge` status in `gbkill` is `yes`, but `NO_FORCE...fully merged` appears when you delete the branch. Reason: `The code of this branch` is not merged into the `currently focused branch`. Requires `forced deletion`

> 3. When executing `gbkill --sync`, the `remote branch` of the target branch will be deleted first and then the `local branch`

## üèñÔ∏è Parameter

> Configurable parameters of `gbkill`. Some configuration parameters will be cached and shared globally in the `/user home directory/.gbkill` file.
